Gaming wise you can find me on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/xabaras89/" target="blank" rel="me">STEAM</a>, I love <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18004930-andrea-corinti" target="blank" rel="me">GOODREADS</a> for books and <a href="https://www.tvtime.com/it/user/2987728/profile" rel="me" target="blank">TVTIME</a> to keep track of the things I watch.

I don't like it very much, but for professional stuff I'm also on [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-corinti/).
