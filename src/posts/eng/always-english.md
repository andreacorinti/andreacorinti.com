I truly enjoy English.

Not only for its cultural significance and relevance in the era in which I was born and reared, but also for the limitless opportunities it provides for communication with individuals all over the world:

I absolutely love how English _sounds_.

_But._

**I must admit that it becomes a little tiresome hearing it all the time** when non-English speaking bands utilize it to sing.

## Loving languages

![haggard](https://www.haggard.de/images/header.png)

This reflection comes from [this post of mine](https://livellosegreto.it/@xabacadabra/111773715282272926) and the poor **Bergtatt** guys,  whom I hope are doing well and continue to play somewhere in the Norwegian regions...

As a kid who was highly interested in the European metal scene, I was disappointed to learn how many Scandinavian, German, and Italian bands used primarily English for their songs. Anyway, I often struggled with this because I enjoy languages.

In fact, it's no coincidence that some of my favorite bands include **Haggard**, **Eluveitie**, **Korpiklaani** and a few others here and there (I've been very into **The HU** lately).

There are examples in Spanish as well, but I must admit that I have never been really enthralled by bands like **Mago de Oz** or **Rata Blanca** (in contrast, I adore the **Soda Stereo**, **Heroes del Silencio** and **Sumo** in a more classic rock scene).

## Promotion

Look, I understand: 

It's OK that a band finds it considerably simpler to enter into an already competitive market by using English.

This was the tale of some of our legendary bands in the Italian metal scene, like **Lacuna Coil**, **Rhapsody**, **Theatre des Vampires**, **Labyrinth**, **Necrodeath**, **Elvenking**, and so forth.

However, it's unfortunate!

Take into consideration that compared to many Italian acts, bands like **Judas Priest** or **Blind Guardian** have probably used more Italian in their works (with hilarious consequences, I must add: check out _Pestilence and plague_ and _Frutto del Buio_).

And let's not even discuss how much I regret the lack of Latinâ€”it's a fantastic language that is, in my opinion, far more useful than Italian in some situations.

## Language as an instrument

![the-hu](https://www.discovermongolia.mn/uploads/the-hu-band-blog-cover.jpg)

The concept is that languages should be thought of as musical instruments because, in fact, _they are one_ and have substantial influence in music:

Did you know that the original version of _My Way_ was the French song _Comme d'habitude_?

Furthermore, language makes it easier and more natural to transmit your culture, which can be used as a differentiator in a crowded landscape of Vikings and Celts...Oh, don't get me wrong: they are cool and all, but a little variation isn't bad, right?

Consider **Orphaned Land** or **Myrath**, and how great it would be to hear them sing less in English!

(Regarding OL, I am not coincidentally in love with _Mabool_, _Sapari_, and _Barakah_)

In a more pop context, and returning to Italy, many non-Italians have confirmed my impression that the most beautiful and powerful songs of **Maneskin** are those in Italian, and that the use of English has made them a bit too generic...pretty much the stuff that happens all the time at Eurovision, which sometimes appears to be made up of UK Top of the Pops reserves.

## Conclusion

If you are not an English speaker and have a band, you may try releasing a single in English to reach a wider audience, but please consider singing in your own language!
