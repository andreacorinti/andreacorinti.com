_This article was first published on March 14, 2017_ [_and it is also available in Italian._](../../ita/Akira-e-Final-Fantasy-VII/)

**WARNING! In this post, I try not to reveal anything about the plots of the two works in question. That being said, I advise you to continue reading only if you are familiar with both of them!**

I've been thinking about this post for about a year[^anno], ever since I read for the first time the manga of the masterpiece by Katsuhiro Otomo, after growing up having watched and rewatched the homonymous movie.

[^anno]: the post was originally written (in Italian) in 2017. 

Let's say I enjoyed analyzing some aspects of **Akira's artistic style**, relating them to what has always been one of my favorite topics:

**_Final Fantasy VII_**.

_The great artistic school of elevators._

## The Importance of Akira

**Akira has been a turning point for Shonen, Seinen, Cyberpunk, and perhaps for Science Fiction as a whole:**

To put it bluntly, we could define it as a sort of **_Divine Comedy_ of modern Japanese pop culture**.

Therefore, let's specify:

**Its influence doesn't start or end with _Final Fantasy VII_, quite the opposite.**

However, since I'm mentioning **two works that are undoubtedly crucial in their respective fields**, let's analyze some possible connections between them.

## The Legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki

**The trauma of the Atomic Bomb has often been depicted in Japanese entertainment**, partly perhaps with the intention of exorcising it:

The total and indiscriminate destruction, annihilating, **in its way both futuristic and modern as well as archaic and mythological**.

Probably, the words of **Oppenheimer** about the [Trinity test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test)) still perfectly describe it:

> We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

On this topic that, in my opinion, it's **crucial to understanding the entire entertainment industry of Japan**, I recommend [this excellent article from _The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/the-deep-influence-of-the-a-bomb-on-anime-and-manga-45275).

## Spirituality and Science

Perhaps also because of what I just mentioned, **Japanese sci-fi often had a taste bordering on the mystical** <small>(congratulations Shinji!)</small>, a kind of <i>"secular religiosity"</i> often heavily influenced both by the post-apocalyptic visions of **George Miller's _Mad Max_** and by **William Gibson's cyberpunk**, or films like _Blade Runner_.

**_Ghost in the Shell_ most likely served as climax of this concept.**

## Motorcycles!

If you follow anime-manga or are simply enthusiasts of Japanese pop culture, you are likely familiar with the figures of the _Bōsōzoku_: 

literally, **_the "Tribe of Reckless Speed._"**

<img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/JapaneseBosozoku.jpg' alt='bosozoku'>

_I know, they look pretty funny!_

In essence, the category of the young **Eikichi Onizuka** (main protagonist of _GTO_ and _Shonan Junai Gumi_), but also, in some ways, "colleagues" of our **Cloud**:

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/gioco-moto-ff7.gif)

_If you think about it, we could say that this mini-game might be the first "Bōsōzoku Simulators"_

It's needless to say that **Kaneda and Tetsuo didn't just embrace this trend, they actually contributed to redefining it:**

Just think about the movie's cover, with Kaneda's back facing us as he looks at his wonderful scarlet motorcycle.

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/akira-cover.jpg)

We're not talking "only" about **one of the most emblematic, referenced, and celebrated images in the history of animation and comics:** 

if you think about it, it's **a real manifesto for the entire aforementioned subculture.**

## Midgar e Neo Tokyo

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/neo-tokyo.jpg)

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/midgard.jpg)

Different yet closely related, as **both are representatives of the hidden nightmare behind the dream of Megacities**:

Whole regions, perhaps true _nations_ rather than mere cities, where the relentless squalor of the suburbs is juxtaposed with the decadent opulence of the rich districts.

Moreover, once again **we return to the highly Japanese issue of traditional roots suffocated in an excessively modern setting**, and it's not by chance that William Gibson baptized it as such:

> "Modern Japan simply was Cyberpunk"

I believe it was inevitable that Otomo's futuristic version of Tokyo would meet some similarities with the _Made in Squaresoft_ Midgard:

Epicenters of technology, pollution, a past suffocated by the relentless need for future, but above all, characterized by tremendous **classism**.

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/ffvii-2.jpg)
_In doubt, let's put a playground somewhere!_

Classism, as is typical in real life, **is reflected both in individuals and in the architecture of the various neighborhoods, or rather, the various _Sectors_**.

## Japan Future-past

This topic, touched upon earlier, is very deep and crucial: 

I won't go into it in-depth because Alessandro "Doctor Manhattan" Apreda (Italian blogger) already [did a wonderful job some years ago](https://docmanhattan.blogspot.it/2014/08/giappone-in-film-fantascienza-anni-80-e-90.html) <small>(I personally consider it one of the most beautiful and powerful posts on the _Antro Atomico_, which says a lot! Translate it if you can, I promise it's worth it)</small>.

Staying on the subject, we can certainly see how **Akira (1988) and Final Fantasy VII (1997) respectively opened and <small>(practically)</small>closed one of the most intensely creative and inspired decades in modern history**, not only conceptually but also in very practical terms:

## How much did Akira and Final Fantasy VII cost?

First of all, manga aside, we have **the most expensive Japanese animated feature film of its time** [^anime]: Akira cost a whopping 8 million dollars, which in 1988 Japan was no small amount.

[^anime]: If I'm not mistaken, the record was broken by Studio Ghibli with Princess Mononoke, but Otomo made up for it in 2004 with the very costly Steamboy.

On the other hand, we have the first major 3D video game, with a budget so exorbitant (**145 million dollars**) that it **still firmly holds a place on the podium of the [most expensive video game productions ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop), the only one in the top 10 to have been released _before 2008_**. [^ff7costs]

[^ff7costs]: Needless to say, this is one of the many reasons why I doubt the remake project.

## Akira and Jenova

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/akira3.jpg)

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/ffvii-3.jpg)

Mysterious and incredibly powerful entities that, **despite appearing relatively rarely or somewhat in the background, represent the epicenter of everything**, starting with the _"Hiroshima effect"_ that I mentioned at the beginning.

Not by chance, **both figures possess a strong mystical, or rather divine, connotation**, the famous spirituality that clashes with science, rationality, **the modern**.

**Primordial spiritualism dueling with unscrupulous progressivism**, albeit with different moral incarnations[^moral].

[^moral]: Akira is a neutral figure at the mercy of events, Jenova represents a parasite physiologically harmful to the Planet

In practice, **we return to the entirely Japanese dichotomy I mentioned earlier when analyzing Midgard and Tokyo**.

![akira e final fantasy vii](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xabacadabra/Xabacadabra.github.io/master/gallery/akira-ff7/sensoji.jpg)

_The ancient Buddhist temple Sensō-ji, nestled in the Asakusa district in the heart of the ultra-modern Japanese capital, is perhaps the perfect emblem to illustrate all this._

Ancient and New, Eastern and Western, Spiritual and Material, Natural and Technological.

Perhaps **the heart of the peculiar charm of sushi-sci-fi lies right there.**

And personally, I'm quite convinced that this unresolved and "peaceful" conflict reached its creative peak precisely between the late '80s and the early years of the new millennium.
