**The Migrants Emergency** is the great human drama of current european age.

Here in Italy it’s a constant matter of controversy, but more generally **we could say that is the phenomenon that fueled the growth of far-right politics across all Union**, as well as one of the main **Brexit** triggers.

## The Nerd Factor:

By looking at the situation in **Ventimiglia**, on the French-Italian border, I instinctively thought of a 2013 indie game:

**Paper Please.**

While **Lucas Pope**’s game is set in a pseudo-Iron Curtain / Cold War context, the human aspects tied with Immigration remains the same.

Divisions, humiliations, **terrorism**: almost all consequences derived from a fundamental concept:

## The border.

_Paper Please_ put us in the role of an **immigration inspector** assigned to a border in **a fictional Orwellian society** which, in spite of its soviet-communist nature, seems to have **many traits in common with contemporary Europe.**

> For the narrative, I felt it was an important way to humanize the consequences of your performance. It also supports the core empathetic message: you’re performing a difficult job with difficult decisions and you often have to choose between caring for your family or doing what you feel is morally right.

> **Games are art and should benefit from the same treatment**. With my generation especially, games are a ubiquitous form of media and they’re becoming easier and easier to create. I think it’s natural to have more personal or contentious topics covered in games.

> Papers Please **isn’t intended as a political game** that highlights any particular injustice. My goal was more to **humanize people that are commonly seen as enemies and to show that all sides of a political issue can have justifications.**

## “Humanize people that are commonly seen as enemies”

That’s really the point UE goverments are missing, often treating people like numbers, or worse: **a threat**.
