_This post is a work in progress!_

Since I've upgraded pretty much everything here, I'm going back to one of the fundamental problems of my website:

**Comments & Interactions**

So, thanks to the amazing posts of [Max Böck](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) and [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/posts/webmentions-eleventy-in-depth/) I'm trying to implementing **Webmentions** and **Bridgy** with little success :| 

## Import the Staticman Oldies 

Back in the day, when I was writing for my Blog-Webzine **Xabacadabra**, I was using [**Staticman**](https://kabardinovd.com/posts/eleventy-staticman/) after dropping Disqus for good.

Sadly, it appears that Staticman wasn’t updated for a while and still has a couple of issues with spam & stuff.
Furthermore, it requires a lot of work to be configured ([Dimitrii Kabardinov explained]( https://kabardinovd.com/posts/eleventy-staticman/) everything in detail, if you’re interested.  

## Utterances

[**Utterances**](https://utteranc.es/) works really well: looks nice, it's easy, light, cool and all, but...

Needs a Github account in order to comment something.

Fine if you have a dev blog in english I guess, not so fine if you've a generic webiste in another language I'm afraid.

## Bridgy 

More the Webmentions per se, I'm pretty intrigued with [**Bridgy**](https://brid.gy/).

I'll try to set up things and, if happy, stick with only Webmentions + Bridgy.
