I'm sure you've read everything about it before, so I'll try to keep it quick and simple.

## Steam Deck isn't a portable console

In fact, it isn't a console at all: you can see it as an incredible small gaming laptop. 

If you see it that way, is amazing since you can save a lot of space without having to worry about external controllers or special supports. 

## The space-saving factor 

A lot of people just can't realize that but, if you had to move a lot, live in a small apartment, and have a job that makes you travel a lot, well... the steam deck is a real lifesaver. 

Personally, I've moved way too many times to ever think about buying a gaming desktop or a TV console ever again: I don't even own a TV!
