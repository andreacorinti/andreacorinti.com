## "What Am I Doing With My Life?"

I think all gamers over twenty five have thought something like this as they started playing _TES Skyrim_ (or whatever) for the thousandth time.

A kind of sense of guilt, something that can hardly hit you while watching a movie or a TV show...

## Addiction 

I wont go there: expecially with online gaming I know is a dangerus thing and, since I'm no doctor, I will not try to address the matter 

## Average Time

Every hobby "wastes" some of your time. 

Watching a movie takes something on the average of the 2 hours, reading a book or watching a tv series generally a couple of hours per day...

A videogame usually takes a lot more.

Of course, in games everything can drasticaly change and you can end Monkey Island or do a speedrun of alot of games in a single afternoon, but usually, if the average serious and big game takes less than 15-20 hours to finish without offering some replaying value that is seen as a major flaw

In this days I've finished my first run of _Dark Souls III_: I've fooled around a lot and did some online playing, and the game took me around 60 hours 

60 hours are something like 30 movies

## 8+ hours straight
