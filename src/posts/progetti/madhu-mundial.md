Short strip made with Krita and some IA work.

I've found out about Madhu Bollapally from [this](https://www.valigiablu.it/mondiali-qatar-lavoro-morti/) Italian article on _Valigia Blu_, but you can read more in English on [_The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) that was also my final source.

Also, please check his page on [Cards of Qatar](https://cardsofqatar.com/en/cards/madhu-bollapally/).

## About

As many Italians I enjoy football, and I think the World Cup is the most beautiful sporting event of all: I absolutely don't want to misjudge those who simply wish to enjoy the games.

But I don't want people to forget what FIFA has done and what has been happening in Qatar all along: numbers and statistics make us forget that what we are talking about are people, individuals like us.
