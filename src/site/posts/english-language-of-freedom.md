Yep, my English it's not so great _awright_.

But I must improve and, if you're a fella non-native speaker, so should you.

Not only for school, work, travel, or hear the original voices in your favorite Netflix series.

But because english is **the language of freedom**.

## Spare me the _America f*ck yeah!_ thing please...

Easy you, my friend. [^friend]

[^friend]: Do you ever notice how many people from the east use A LOT the "my friend" sentece? Nothing against it mind you, but I find it a little creepy. Maybe it's because I'm italian (_"amico mio..."_ in italian urban dictionary sounds like a _threat_ !)

English is the language of freedom because, thanks to internet and the current western world culture, it's by all means the [_Lingua Franca_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_English) of the entire globe.

And that's why I'm focused on writing in english: to be able to _connect_ with all kinds of audiences (a thing that many anglophones take for granted).

In addition to this, **english is essential for coding**.

```java
public class englishIsCrucial {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean englishKnowledge;

        if (englishKnowledge == true) {
          System.out.println("Wonderful!");
        } else {
          System.out.println("mamma mia!");
        }
    }

}
```

## So, my English sucks

Or at least that's what I _feel_.

I mean, it's not like that I can't write some tweets or small sentences...

Hell, I can even make a decent amount of pages writing in English and, if I'm not too bored, do a nice grammar revision to correct eventual mistakes.

But to achieve **creative writing**, o what I call **_liberating writing_**, comfort is _crucial_.

And to get there, I need to practice!
